Mini Challenge #9 - Restaurant Picker
In this challenge you are going to either get a random
restaurant or you can choose a category of food

Peer review by Carlos Felipe: The program runs well. I like how the random restaurant is somewhat designed graphically. I especially like the "For an Adventure" choice that gives you a fun idea for eating out. The random choice is so random I could not.
